## fedis

For now, this is a *highly experimental* toolkit for creating Fediverse
applications. If this stabilizes and gains some traction, we will probably
make it a Typelevel library of some sort, but for the time being,
everything is subject to change while we figure stuff out.

### Usage

This library is currently available for Scala binary versions 2.13 and 3.1.

To use the latest version, include the following in your `build.sbt`:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.querki" %% "fedis" % "@VERSION@"
)
```
